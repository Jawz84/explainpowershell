# explainpowershell

PowerShell version of [explainshell.com](explainshell.com)

Initial idea [published on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jawz_84/status/1279856845570682880?s=20)

On ExplainShell.com, you can enter a Linux terminal oneliner, and the site will analyze it, and return snippets from the proper man-pages, in an effort to explain the oneliner. 
I would like to create the same thing but for PowerShell. 

At this point I have a proof of concept that kind of looks like the screenshot below.
